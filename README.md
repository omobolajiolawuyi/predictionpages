Heart Disease Prediction

Overview

This project employs a several clasifferes but chose Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict heart disease based on comprehensive health conditions. The machine learning model utilizes a dataset encompassing key health parameters, including cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and lifestyle habits.

Model Performance

During the evaluation phase, the SVM classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 90.9%. These figures underscore the robustness of the model in providing accurate predictions, showcasing its potential as a valuable tool for the early detection of heart disease.

Deployment

The model has been successfully deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform, using a Python script. This ensures accessibility and scalability for real-world applications.

Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.

Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Execute the Python script for the SVM model.
Feel free to explore the Notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis and model development.

Acknowledgments

This project highlights the impact of machine learning in the field of predictive modeling and underscores the importance of early detection in mitigating heart disease risks.
